# DATA: A toolset for detecting bugs in programs.


- [DATA-Dang](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/Dang) is a lightweight approach to mitigate dangling pointers at runtime by inserting intermediate pointers between a pointer and an object that the pointer points to. 

- [DATA-SAT](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/SAT) is a CNN-based constraint prediction tool that accerlates constraint solving in symbolic execution.
 
- [DATA-GINN](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/GINN) is a new graph neural architecture, which focuses exclusively on intervals (generally manifested in looping construct) for mining the feature representation of a program. Furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs.

- [DATA-SA](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/SA) is a staged approach to resolve this paradox dilemma between precision and scalablity of data race detection. 


- [DATA-SSD](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/SSD) is a tool that detects data races in interrupt-driven program. It uses a combination of static analysis,
symbolic execution and dynamic simulation to synthesize the
failure-inducing data input and interrupt interleaving schedule.

- [DATA-Dataset](https://github.com/ITWOI/DATA/tree/main/Dataset) is a bug dataset based n defect4j, bugs-dot-jar, BugSwarm and the extended dataset from ye et. al [fse'14].
