List are two data race in power.c. The race are between PuT DataSave 
and ISR RsManageA(RsManageB), and DataSave is called by mainFun.
Because DataSave is too simple and compiler optimizates it. 
So only when change PuT to mainFun can simics detect the race. 
If we disable compiler optimization, then set PuT to DataSave is
detectable.
Readers can find the difference between two symbol files.
